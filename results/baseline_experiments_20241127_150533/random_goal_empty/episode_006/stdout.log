You are facing south.

The path ahead is clear.
=====================

Reasoning: Since I am facing south and the path ahead is clear, the most efficient action to take is to move forward towards the goal (G). 

Therefore, I will respond with the action:

Generated action: forward

Executing action: forward (value: 2)
Step result: reward=0, terminated=False, truncated=False

You are facing south.

The path ahead is clear.
=====================

Reasoning: Since I am currently facing south and the path ahead is clear, I can continue moving forward towards the goal (G). There are no obstacles in my way, so the most efficient action is to move one step forward.

=== Current State ===
You are facing south.

There is a wall directly ahead.
=====================

Reasoning: Since I am currently facing south and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I can either turn left or right. 

If I turn left, I will be facing east, and if I turn right, I will be facing west. I need to choose a direction that allows me to continue making progress toward the goal (G). 

Turning left (to face east) seems like a good option, as it may provide a clear path to move forward. 

Therefore, I will take the action: 

Generated action: left

Executing action: left (value: 0)
Step result: reward=0, terminated=False, truncated=False

=== Current State ===
You are facing east.

There is a wall directly ahead.
=====================

Reasoning: Since I am currently facing east and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. The next logical step is to change my direction. I can either turn left to face north or right to face south. 

Turning left to face north seems like a good option because it may open up more potential paths to navigate towards the goal. 

Therefore, I will take the action:

Generated action: left

Executing action: left (value: 0)
Step result: reward=0, terminated=False, truncated=False

The goal is ahead and to the left.
=====================

Reasoning: In the current state, I am facing north and the path ahead is clear. However, the goal (G) is located ahead and to the left. Since I am facing north, to reach the goal, I need to turn left to face west, where the goal is located. 

Therefore, the most efficient action to take is to turn left.

The goal is ahead and to the left.
=====================

Reasoning: In the current state, I am facing north, and the goal is located to my left. Since the path ahead is clear, I can move forward, but that won't take me closer to the goal. Instead, I should turn left to face west, which will allow me to move directly towards the goal.

Therefore, the most efficient action to take is to turn left.

=====================

Reasoning: In the current state, I am facing north, and the goal is located ahead and to the left. Since the path ahead is clear, I can move forward. However, since the goal is to the left, I should first turn left to face the direction of the goal. 

Therefore, the most efficient action to take right now is to turn left, which will position me to move towards the goal in the next step.

=====================

Reasoning: In the current state, I am facing north, but there is a wall directly in front of me, which means I cannot move forward. Since the goal is to the left, I need to turn left to face that direction. After turning left, I will be able to move towards the goal.

Therefore, the most efficient action to take right now is to turn left.

=== Current State ===
You are facing north.

There is a wall directly ahead.
The goal is to the left.
=====================

Reasoning: In the current state, I am facing north and there is a wall directly in front of me. Since I cannot move forward due to the wall, I need to change my orientation to reach the goal, which is located to my left. 

To efficiently navigate towards the goal, I should turn left, which will allow me to face west. From there, I can then move towards the goal.

Therefore, the next action I will take is:
