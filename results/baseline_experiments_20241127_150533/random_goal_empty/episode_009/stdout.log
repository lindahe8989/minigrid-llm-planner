You are facing south.

The path ahead is clear.
=====================

Reasoning: Since I am facing south and the path ahead is clear, the most efficient action to take is to move forward towards the goal. 

Therefore, I will respond with: 

Generated action: forward

Executing action: forward (value: 2)
Step result: reward=0, terminated=False, truncated=False

=== Current State ===
You are facing south.

There is a wall directly ahead.
=====================

Reasoning: Since I am currently facing south and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I need to change my direction. 

The most efficient action would be to turn either left or right. Turning left would have me face east, and turning right would have me face west. Since I do not have information about what lies in those directions, I will choose to turn left to face east.

Generated action: action: left

=====================

Reasoning: Since I am currently facing south and there is a wall directly in front of me, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I can either turn left or right. 

If I turn left, I will be facing east, and I can then check if the path is clear in that direction. If I turn right, I will be facing west, and I can also check that direction. 

To proceed efficiently towards the goal, I will choose to turn left, as it may provide a clearer path to continue moving towards the goal.

=====================

Reasoning: Since I am currently facing west and the path ahead is clear, I can continue moving forward towards the goal. There are no walls blocking my path, and I have already moved in this direction multiple times without encountering any obstacles. Therefore, the most efficient action is to move forward.

=====================

Reasoning: Since I am currently facing west and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I can either turn left or right. 

If I turn left, I will be facing south, and if I turn right, I will be facing north. Both directions may allow me to find a clear path towards the goal. However, since I have not yet explored the area to the left or right, I will choose to turn right first, as it may provide a clearer path.

Therefore, the action I will take is:

There is a wall directly ahead.
=====================

Reasoning: Since I am currently facing south and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I can either turn left or right. 

If I turn left, I will be facing east, and I can then check if the path is clear in that direction. If I turn right, I will be facing west, and I can also check if the path is clear in that direction. 

To maximize my options and potentially find a clear path towards the goal, I will choose to turn left first.

If I turn left, I will be facing east, and if I turn right, I will be facing west. Both directions should allow me to move forward without hitting a wall. However, since I don't have information about what lies to the left or right, I will choose to turn left to face east.

Reasoning: Since I am facing east and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I can either turn left or right. 

If I turn left, I will be facing north, and if I turn right, I will be facing south. I need to choose one of these directions to find a clear path towards the goal (G). 

Turning left (to face north) might provide a clearer path, as I can then assess the surroundings. 

Therefore, I will take the action:
