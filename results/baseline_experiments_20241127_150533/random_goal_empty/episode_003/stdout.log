=====================

Reasoning: Since I am facing south and the path ahead is clear, the most efficient action to take is to move forward towards the goal. 

Therefore, I will respond with the action:

Generated action: forward

Executing action: forward (value: 2)

=== Current State ===
You are facing south.

There is a wall directly ahead.
=====================

Reasoning: Since I am currently facing south and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I can either turn left or right. 

If I turn left, I will be facing east, and if I turn right, I will be facing west. I need to choose a direction that allows me to continue making progress towards the goal (G). 

Turning left (to face east) seems like a good option because it may allow me to move forward without hitting a wall, depending on the layout of the grid beyond my current view.

Therefore, I will take the action: 

Generated action: left

Executing action: left (value: 0)
Step result: reward=0, terminated=False, truncated=False

If I turn left, I will be facing north, and if I turn right, I will be facing south. I need to choose one of these directions to find a clear path towards the goal.

Turning left (to face north) might provide more options since I can then explore the area to the left. However, turning right (to face south) could also lead to a clear path depending on the layout of the grid.

Given that I need to make a decision, I will choose to turn left, as it may open up more potential paths.

The path ahead is clear.
=====================

Reasoning: Since I am currently facing west and the path ahead is clear, I can continue moving towards the goal. The goal is ahead and to the left, so I will first need to turn left to face south, and then I can move forward towards the goal.

Given that the path ahead is clear, I will take the action to turn left.

=====================

Reasoning: Since I am currently facing west and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I need to change my direction. The most efficient way to do this is to turn right, which will allow me to face north and potentially find a clear path towards the goal.
