=== Current State ===
You are facing south.

There is a wall directly ahead.
=====================

Reasoning: Since I am currently facing south and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I can either turn left or right. 

Turning left will orient me towards the east, while turning right will orient me towards the west. Since I don't have information about what lies in those directions, I will choose to turn left first, as it may provide a clearer path towards the goal.

=====================

Reasoning: Since I am facing south and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I can either turn left or right. 

If I turn left, I will be facing east, and I can then check if the path is clear to move in that direction. If I turn right, I will be facing west, and I can also check for a clear path. 

To maximize my options, I will turn left first, as it may provide a clearer path towards the goal.

You are facing south.

There is a wall directly ahead.
=====================

Reasoning: Since I am facing south and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I can either turn left or right. 

Turning left will have me face east, and turning right will have me face west. I need to choose a direction that allows me to continue moving towards the goal (G). 

If I turn left (to face east), I can then check if the path is clear in that direction. If I turn right (to face west), I can also check for a clear path. 

Given that I have not yet explored the east direction, I will choose to turn left.

If I turn left, I will be facing east, and I can then check if the path is clear in that direction. If I turn right, I will be facing west, and I can also check for a clear path. 

Given that I need to move efficiently towards the goal, I will choose to turn left, as it may provide a clearer path to navigate around the wall.

If I turn left, I will be facing east, and if I turn right, I will be facing west. Either direction will allow me to move forward in the next step. However, without additional information about the surrounding environment, I will choose to turn left to face east.

=== Current State ===

There is a wall directly ahead.
=====================

Reasoning: Since I am facing south and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I need to change my direction. The most efficient way to do this is to turn either left or right. 

If I turn left, I will be facing east, and if I turn right, I will be facing west. Both directions should allow me to move forward without hitting a wall. However, I will choose to turn left to face east, as it is generally more common to navigate towards the right side of a grid.

Therefore, the action I will take is:

=== Current State ===
You are facing east.

There is a wall directly ahead.
=====================

Reasoning: Since I am currently facing east and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. The next best option is to change my direction. I can either turn left to face north or turn right to face south. 

Turning left to face north seems more promising because it may allow me to explore more of the grid without running into walls immediately. 

Therefore, I will take the action:

There is a wall directly ahead.
=====================

Reasoning: Since I am facing west and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I can either turn left or right. 

If I turn left, I will be facing south, and if I turn right, I will be facing north. I need to choose a direction that allows me to continue moving towards the goal (G). 

Turning left (south) may provide a clearer path, as I can then assess the next steps. 

Therefore, I will take the action: 

Generated action: left

Executing action: left (value: 0)
Step result: reward=0, terminated=False, truncated=False

Reasoning: Since I am currently facing south and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. The next best option is to change my direction. I can either turn left to face east or right to face west. 

Turning left to face east seems more promising because it may open up a path towards the goal (G) without backtracking. 

Therefore, I will take the action to turn left.

Reasoning: Since I am currently facing south and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. The next logical step is to change my direction. I can either turn left to face east or right to face west. 

Turning left to face east seems more promising because I have already moved west and encountered walls. By turning left, I can explore new paths that might lead me closer to the goal (G).

There is a wall directly ahead.
=====================

Reasoning: Since I am facing west and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. The next best action is to change my orientation. I can turn either left or right. 

Turning left will make me face south, and turning right will make me face north. Since I don't have information about what lies in those directions, I can choose either option. However, turning left (south) is generally a good choice as it often opens up more paths in grid navigation.

I will take the action to turn left.
