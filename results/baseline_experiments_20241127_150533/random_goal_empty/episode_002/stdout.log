You are facing south.

The path ahead is clear.
=====================

Reasoning: Since I am currently facing south and the path ahead is clear, the most efficient action is to move forward towards the goal (G). 

Therefore, I will respond with the action: 

Generated action: forward

Executing action: forward (value: 2)
Step result: reward=0, terminated=False, truncated=False

=== Current State ===
You are facing south.

There is a wall directly ahead.
=====================

Reasoning: Since I am currently facing south and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I can either turn left or right. 

Turning left will orient me to face east, while turning right will orient me to face west. I should choose to turn left, as it is likely to provide a clearer path towards the goal (G) based on typical grid layouts.

Therefore, the action I will take is:

Generated action: left

Executing action: left (value: 0)
Step result: reward=0, terminated=False, truncated=False

=== Current State ===
You are facing east.

There is a wall directly ahead.
=====================

Reasoning: Since I am currently facing east and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. The next best option is to change my direction. I can either turn left to face north or right to face south. 

Turning left (to face north) would allow me to explore the area without hitting a wall, as I would then have the option to move forward. 

Therefore, the most efficient action is to turn left.

=====================

Reasoning: Since I am facing east and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. The next best action is to change my direction. I can either turn left to face north or turn right to face south. 

Turning left to face north seems more promising because it may allow me to explore further without immediately encountering another wall. 

Therefore, I will take the action to turn left.

Reasoning: Since I am facing west and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I can either turn left or right. 

If I turn left, I will be facing south, and I can then check if the path is clear in that direction. If I turn right, I will be facing north, and I can also check that direction. 

To explore my options, I will turn right, which will allow me to potentially find a clear path towards the goal.

If I turn left, I will be facing south. If I turn right, I will be facing north. Since I don't have information about what lies in those directions, I will choose to turn left to face south, as it might provide a clearer path.

Reasoning: Since I am facing west and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I can either turn left or right. 

If I turn left, I will be facing south, and if I turn right, I will be facing north. I need to choose a direction that allows me to continue moving towards the goal (G). 

Turning left (south) may provide more options to move forward, while turning right (north) might also lead to potential paths. However, since I have not encountered any walls on either side, I will choose to turn left.

=====================

Reasoning: Since I am facing west and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I can either turn left or right. 

If I turn left, I will be facing south, and if I turn right, I will be facing north. I need to consider which direction might allow me to move towards the goal (G) more efficiently. 

Given that I cannot see the entire grid and only have a limited field of vision, I will choose to turn right, which will allow me to explore the area to the north. 

Therefore, the action I will take is:
