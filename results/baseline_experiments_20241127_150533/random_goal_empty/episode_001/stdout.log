=== Current State ===
You are facing south.

There is a wall directly ahead.
=====================

Reasoning: Since I am currently facing south and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I need to change my direction. 

The most efficient way to proceed would be to turn either left or right. Since I don't have information about what is to my left or right, I will choose to turn right. This will allow me to explore a new direction and potentially find a clear path towards the goal.

=== Current State ===
You are facing south.

There is a wall directly ahead.
=====================

Reasoning: Since I am facing south and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I can either turn left or right. 

If I turn left, I will be facing east, and I can then check if the path is clear in that direction. If I turn right, I will be facing west, and I can also check that direction. 

To maximize my options, I will choose to turn left, which will allow me to explore the east direction next.

Reasoning: Since I am facing south and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. The next best option is to change my direction. I can either turn left or right. 

If I turn left, I will be facing east, and if I turn right, I will be facing west. I need to choose a direction that will allow me to navigate around the wall and continue towards the goal. 

Turning left (to face east) seems like a reasonable choice, as it may open up more pathways to explore. 

Therefore, I will take the action:

=== Current State ===
You are facing north.

There is a wall directly ahead.
The goal is to the left.
=====================

Reasoning: Since I am facing north and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. However, the goal is to my left. To reach the goal efficiently, I should turn left to face west, which will allow me to move towards the goal.

Therefore, the action I will take is:

Generated action: left

Executing action: left (value: 0)
Step result: reward=0, terminated=False, truncated=False
