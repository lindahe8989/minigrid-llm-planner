You are facing south.

There is a wall directly ahead.
=====================

Reasoning: Since I am currently facing south and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I can either turn left or right. 

If I turn left, I will be facing east, and I can then move forward if the path is clear. If I turn right, I will be facing west, and I can also check if the path is clear in that direction. 

To proceed efficiently, I will choose to turn left, as it is often beneficial to explore new directions rather than retracing steps.

There is a wall directly ahead.
=====================

Reasoning: Since I am facing south and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I can either turn left or right. 

Turning left will have me face east, and turning right will have me face west. I need to choose a direction that allows me to continue making progress towards the goal (G). 

Given that I have not encountered any obstacles to the east or west in previous steps, I will choose to turn left to face east. This will allow me to explore the area and find a clear path towards the goal.

=====================

Reasoning: Since I am facing west and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I can either turn left or right. 

If I turn left, I will be facing south, and I can then check if the path is clear in that direction. If I turn right, I will be facing north, and I can also check if the path is clear in that direction. 

To explore my options, I will turn right, which will allow me to assess the situation in the north direction.

Reasoning: Since I am facing west and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I can either turn left or right. 

Turning left will face me south, while turning right will face me north. I need to determine which direction might lead me closer to the goal (G). 

Given that I cannot see beyond the immediate area, I will choose to turn right to face north, as it may provide more options for movement in the next steps.

If I turn left, I will be facing south, and if I turn right, I will be facing north. I need to choose a direction that allows me to continue moving towards the goal (G). 

Turning left (to face south) may provide more options for movement, as I can then potentially move forward if there are no walls in that direction.
