=== Current State ===
You are facing south.

There is a wall directly ahead.
=====================

Reasoning: Since I am currently facing south and there is a wall directly in front of me, I cannot move forward. To proceed towards the goal, I need to change my direction. The most efficient way to navigate around the wall is to turn either left or right. 

If I turn left, I will be facing east, and if I turn right, I will be facing west. Either direction could potentially allow me to find a clear path. However, since I have not encountered any obstacles to the left or right in the previous steps, I will choose to turn left to face east.

If I turn left, I will be facing east, and if I turn right, I will be facing west. Both directions should allow me to move forward since I have no information about walls in those directions. 

To proceed efficiently, I will turn left to face east, as it is generally a good practice to explore new directions first.

=====================

Reasoning: Since I am currently facing east and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. The next best action is to change my orientation. I can either turn left to face north or turn right to face south. 

Turning left to face north seems more promising because it may open up more potential paths to explore. After turning left, I can then assess the new surroundings and decide on the next action.

Therefore, I will take the action:

=====================

Reasoning: In the current state, I am facing north and the path ahead is clear. However, the goal (G) is located ahead and to the left. To reach the goal efficiently, I should first turn left to face west, which will align me directly towards the goal. After that, I can move forward towards the goal.

Given this reasoning, the next action I should take is to turn left.

=====================

Reasoning: In the current state, I am facing west, and the goal is located ahead and to the right. To move towards the goal efficiently, I need to turn right to face the direction of the goal. 

Since the path ahead is clear, I can take the action of turning right first, which will position me to face north, where the goal is located. 

Therefore, the next action I will take is:

=== Current State ===
You are facing north.

There is a wall directly ahead.
The goal is to the left.
=====================

Reasoning: In the current state, I am facing north with a wall directly in front of me. Since I cannot move forward, I need to change my orientation to reach the goal, which is located to my left. 

To do this, I will turn left, which will change my direction to face west. This will allow me to then move towards the goal in subsequent steps.

=== Current State ===
You are facing north.

There is a wall directly ahead.
The goal is to the left.
=====================

Reasoning: In the current state, I am facing north with a wall directly in front of me. The goal is located to my left. Since I cannot move forward due to the wall, I need to change my orientation to face the direction of the goal. 

To reach the goal, I can turn left to face west, where the goal is located. This will allow me to move towards the goal in the next step. 

Therefore, the action I will take is:
