=== Current State ===
You are facing south.

There is a wall directly ahead.
=====================

Reasoning: Since I am currently facing south and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I need to change my direction. The most efficient way to do this is to turn either left or right. 

If I turn left, I will be facing east, and if I turn right, I will be facing west. Either direction could potentially lead to a clear path, but I will choose to turn left to face east.

=====================

Reasoning: Since I am currently facing west and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I can either turn left or right. 

If I turn left, I will be facing south, and I can then check if the path is clear in that direction. If I turn right, I will be facing north, and I can also check the path in that direction. 

To proceed efficiently, I will turn right, as it may provide a clearer path towards the goal without needing to backtrack.

=====================

Reasoning: Since I am currently facing west and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I should turn either left or right. 

Turning left will have me face south, while turning right will have me face north. I need to consider which direction might lead me closer to the goal (G). 

If I turn left (south), I can then move forward if the path is clear, potentially allowing me to navigate around the wall. 

Therefore, the most efficient action to take right now is to turn left.

=====================

Reasoning: Since I am facing west and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I can either turn left or right. 

Turning left will have me face south, and turning right will have me face north. I should choose to turn left to face south, as this direction may provide a clearer path towards the goal (G). 

Thus, the action I will take is:

Generated action: left

Executing action: left (value: 0)
Step result: reward=0, terminated=False, truncated=False

=== Current State ===
You are facing east.

There is a wall directly ahead.
=====================

Reasoning: Since I am facing east and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I need to change my direction. The most efficient way to do this is to turn left or right. 

If I turn left, I will be facing north, and if I turn right, I will be facing south. Either direction could potentially allow me to find a path around the wall. However, without additional information about the surrounding environment, I will choose to turn left, as it may provide a clearer path.

There is a wall directly ahead.
=====================

Reasoning: Since I am facing east and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. The next best action is to change my direction. I can either turn left to face north or turn right to face south. 

To make progress towards the goal, I will turn left to face north, as this direction may provide an opportunity to navigate around the wall.

There is a wall directly ahead.
=====================

Reasoning: Since I am facing east and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I can either turn left or right. 

If I turn left, I will be facing north, and if I turn right, I will be facing south. I need to choose one of these directions to find a path towards the goal (G). 

Turning left (to face north) might provide more options to move forward, as I could potentially find an opening or a path that leads toward the goal. 

Therefore, I will take the action:

=====================

Reasoning: In the current state, I am facing north, and the goal is located ahead and to the left. Since I can move forward without any obstacles in my path, I will first move forward to get closer to the goal. After that, I may need to turn left to align myself directly with the goal if it is not directly in front of me after the forward move.

Given that the path ahead is clear, I will take the action to move forward.
