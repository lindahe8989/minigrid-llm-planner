There is a wall directly ahead.
=====================

Reasoning: Since I am currently facing east and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I need to change my direction. The most efficient way to do this is to turn left, which will allow me to face north and potentially find a clear path towards the goal.

You are facing north.

There is a wall directly ahead.
=====================

Reasoning: Since I am currently facing north and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. The next logical step is to change my direction. I can either turn left or right. 

If I turn left, I will be facing west, and if I turn right, I will be facing east. Since I have previously encountered walls when facing east, it would be more beneficial to turn left and face west, as it may provide a clearer path.

Therefore, I will take the action to turn left.

=====================

Reasoning: Since I am facing north and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. The next logical step is to turn either left or right to find a new path. 

If I turn left, I will be facing west, and if I turn right, I will be facing east. Since I have already encountered a wall while facing east, turning left to face west seems to be the better option, as it may provide a new direction to explore.

Therefore, I will take the action:

=== Current State ===
You are facing west.

There is a wall directly ahead.
=====================

Reasoning: Since I am facing west and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I can either turn left or right. 

If I turn left, I will be facing south, and I can then check if there is a clear path in that direction. If I turn right, I will be facing north, and I can also check for a clear path there. 

To explore my options, I will turn right, which will allow me to see if there is a path available to the north. 

Generated action: action: right

Executing action: forward (value: 2)
Step result: reward=0, terminated=False, truncated=False

You are facing west.

There is a wall directly ahead.
=====================

Reasoning: Since I am facing west and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I can turn either left or right. 

If I turn left, I will be facing south, and if I turn right, I will be facing north. I need to choose one of these directions to find a path towards the goal (G). 

Turning left (south) might open up more options for movement, as I can then potentially move forward or explore further. 

Therefore, I will take the action:
