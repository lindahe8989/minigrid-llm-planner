=== Current State ===
You are facing east.

There is a wall directly ahead.
=====================

Reasoning: Since I am currently facing east and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I can either turn left or right. 

Turning left will have me face north, and turning right will have me face south. I need to decide which direction will allow me to continue moving towards the goal (G). 

If I turn left (to face north), I can then move forward if the path is clear. If I turn right (to face south), I will also need to check if that path is clear. 

Since I don't have information about the surroundings beyond the immediate wall, I will choose to turn left, as it is often a good strategy to explore new directions when faced with an obstacle.

If I turn left, I will be facing north, and I can then check if there is a clear path in that direction. If I turn right, I will be facing south, and I can also check for a clear path. 

To maximize my options, I will turn left first.

=== Current State ===
You are facing east.

There is a wall directly ahead.
=====================

Reasoning: Since I am facing east and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I can either turn left or right. 

If I turn left, I will be facing north, and I can then check if there is a path available in that direction. If I turn right, I will be facing south, and I can also check for a path in that direction. 

To explore my options, I will choose to turn left first, as it may provide a clearer path towards the goal.

Reasoning: Since I am facing east and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I can either turn left or right. 

If I turn left, I will be facing north, and if I turn right, I will be facing south. I should choose to turn left to face north, as it may provide a clearer path towards the goal (G) without immediately encountering another wall.

You are facing north.

There is a wall directly ahead.
=====================

Reasoning: Since I am currently facing north and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. The next logical step is to change my direction. I can either turn left or right. 

If I turn left, I will be facing west, and if I turn right, I will be facing east. Since I have already faced east and encountered walls, turning left to face west seems like a better option to explore new directions.

Therefore, I will take the action to turn left.

=== Current State ===
You are facing east.

There is a wall directly ahead.
=====================

Reasoning: Since I am currently facing east and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I can either turn left or right. 

Turning left will orient me to face north, while turning right will orient me to face south. I need to choose one of these options to continue moving towards the goal (G). 

Given that I have not encountered any obstacles to the north or south in the previous steps, I will choose to turn left to face north, as this may provide a clearer path towards the goal.

=====================

Reasoning: Since I am currently facing east and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I can either turn left or right. 

If I turn left, I will be facing north, and I can then check if there is a clear path in that direction. If I turn right, I will be facing south, which may also provide a clear path. 

Given that I need to move efficiently towards the goal and I have no information about the surroundings beyond the immediate wall, I will choose to turn left.

=====================

Reasoning: Since I am facing east and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I can either turn left or right. 

If I turn left, I will be facing north, and I can then assess if there is a clear path in that direction. If I turn right, I will be facing south, and I can also check for a clear path. 

To maximize my options, I will turn left first, as it may provide a clearer route towards the goal.

=====================

Reasoning: Since I am facing east and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. The next best action is to change my direction. I can either turn left to face north or turn right to face south. 

Turning left to face north might open up more options to navigate around the wall. Therefore, I will choose to turn left.

=====================

Reasoning: Since I am facing east and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I can either turn left or right. 

- If I turn left, I will be facing north, and I can then check if there is a clear path in that direction.
- If I turn right, I will be facing south, and I can also check for a clear path in that direction.

To explore my options, I will choose to turn left first, as it may provide a new path towards the goal.

You are facing east.

There is a wall directly ahead.
=====================

Reasoning: Since I am facing east and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I can either turn left or right. 

- If I turn left, I will be facing north.
- If I turn right, I will be facing south.

Both options may allow me to find a new path towards the goal (G). However, turning right (south) might provide more options to explore since I can then potentially move forward if there are no walls in that direction.

Therefore, I will take the action:

Generated action: right

Executing action: right (value: 1)
Step result: reward=0, terminated=False, truncated=False
