Reasoning: Since I am currently facing east and there is a wall directly in front of me, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I can either turn left or right. 

If I turn left, I will be facing north, and I can then check if there is a clear path in that direction. If I turn right, I will be facing south, and I can also check for a clear path in that direction. 

To proceed efficiently, I will choose to turn left, as it may provide a clearer path towards the goal.

Reasoning: Since I am currently facing north and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. The next step is to change my direction. I can either turn left or right. 

If I turn left, I will be facing west, and if I turn right, I will be facing east. Since I have already encountered walls when facing east, turning left to face west seems to be the better option as it may allow me to explore new paths.

Reasoning: Since I am facing north and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I need to change my direction. The most efficient way to do this is to turn either left or right. 

If I turn left, I will be facing west, and if I turn right, I will be facing east. Since I don't have information about what lies in those directions, I can choose either direction. However, turning right (to face east) is a common choice in navigation as it may provide more options for movement.

Therefore, I will take the action to turn right.

=== Current State ===
You are facing north.

There is a wall directly ahead.
=====================

Reasoning: Since I am facing north and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I should turn either left or right. 

If I turn left, I will be facing west, and if I turn right, I will be facing east. I need to choose one of these directions to find a path towards the goal (G). 

Turning left (to face west) may provide a better chance of finding an open path, as I can then explore the area to my left. 

Therefore, I will take the action: 

Generated action: left

Executing action: left (value: 0)
Step result: reward=0, terminated=False, truncated=False

=== Current State ===
You are facing south.

There is a wall directly ahead.
=====================

Reasoning: Since I am facing south and there is a wall directly in front of me, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I need to change my direction. The most efficient way to do this is to turn either left or right. 

If I turn left, I will be facing east, and if I turn right, I will be facing west. I will choose to turn left, as it may provide more options to move towards the goal.

Generated action: action: left

Executing action: forward (value: 2)
Step result: reward=0, terminated=False, truncated=False

=== Current State ===
You are facing south.

There is a wall directly ahead.
=====================

Reasoning: Since I am facing south and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I can either turn left or right. 

If I turn left, I will be facing east, and if I turn right, I will be facing west. I need to choose one of these options to find a path towards the goal (G). 

Turning left (to face east) may provide more options for movement since I can then move forward if there is no wall in that direction. 

Therefore, I will take the action:

Executing action: left (value: 0)
