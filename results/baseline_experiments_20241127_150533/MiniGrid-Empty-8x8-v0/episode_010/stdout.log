You are facing east.

There is a wall directly ahead.
=====================

Reasoning: Since I am currently facing east and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. The next best option is to change my direction. I can either turn left to face north or turn right to face south. 

To determine the best action, I will turn left to face north. This will allow me to explore new paths without running into the wall.

=====================

Reasoning: Since I am facing east and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. To proceed towards the goal, I need to change my direction. The most efficient way to do this is to turn left (to face north) or right (to face south). 

Turning left will allow me to explore the area without hitting the wall, and I can then assess the path ahead. 

I will take the action:

You are facing north.

There is a wall directly ahead.
=====================

Reasoning: Since I am currently facing north and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. The next logical step is to change my direction. I can either turn left or right. 

If I turn left, I will be facing west, and if I turn right, I will be facing east. Since I have previously moved east and encountered walls, turning left to face west may provide a new path to explore. 

Therefore, I will turn left.

=== Current State ===
You are facing north.

There is a wall directly ahead.
=====================

Reasoning: In the current state, I am facing north, but there is a wall directly in front of me, which means I cannot move forward. To navigate around this wall, I need to change my direction. The most efficient action would be to turn left, which will change my orientation to face west. This will allow me to explore other potential paths towards the goal.

Therefore, the action I will take is:

=== Current State ===
You are facing west.

There is a wall directly ahead.
=====================

Reasoning: Since I am facing west and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I can either turn left or right. 

If I turn left, I will be facing south, and if I turn right, I will be facing north. I need to choose a direction that allows me to continue moving towards the goal (G). 

Turning left (to face south) may provide a clear path, while turning right (to face north) might also allow for movement. However, without additional information about the surrounding area, I will choose to turn left first, as it is often a good strategy to explore new directions.

There is a wall directly ahead.
=====================

Reasoning: Since I am facing west and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I can either turn left or right. 

If I turn left, I will be facing south, and if I turn right, I will be facing north. I need to choose one of these directions to find a clear path towards the goal (G). 

Turning left (south) may provide a better opportunity to find an open path, as it is often less obstructed in grid environments. 

Therefore, I will take the action:
