There is a wall directly ahead.
=====================

Reasoning: Since I am currently facing east and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I can either turn left or right. 

If I turn left, I will be facing north, and I can then check if the path is clear in that direction. If I turn right, I will be facing south, and I can also check if the path is clear in that direction. 

To maximize my options, I will turn left first, as it may lead to an open path towards the goal.

You are facing north.

There is a wall directly ahead.
=====================

Reasoning: Since I am currently facing north and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. The next logical step is to change my orientation. I can either turn left or right to find a clear path. 

If I turn left, I will be facing west, and if I turn right, I will be facing east. However, I know that I previously faced east and encountered walls there as well. Therefore, turning left to face west is the better option, as it may provide a new direction to explore.

I will take the action:

There is a wall directly ahead.
=====================

Reasoning: Since I am currently facing west and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I can either turn left or right. 

Turning left will have me face south, while turning right will have me face north. I need to choose one of these directions to continue moving towards the goal (G). 

Given that I have not encountered any obstacles in the previous steps when moving west, it is likely that turning left (to face south) will provide a clear path forward. Therefore, I will turn left.

You are facing west.

There is a wall directly ahead.
=====================

Reasoning: Since I am facing west and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I can either turn left or right. 

If I turn left, I will be facing south, and I can then move forward if the path is clear. If I turn right, I will be facing north, and I can also move forward if that path is clear. 

To explore my options, I will turn right, which will allow me to potentially find a new path towards the goal.

Reasoning: Since I am facing west and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I can either turn left or right. 

If I turn left, I will be facing south, and if I turn right, I will be facing north. I need to choose a direction that allows me to continue moving towards the goal (G). 

Turning left (south) may provide more options for movement, as I can then potentially move forward or turn again.
