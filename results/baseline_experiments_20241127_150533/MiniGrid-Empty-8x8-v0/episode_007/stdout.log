There is a wall directly ahead.
=====================

Reasoning: Since I am currently facing east and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. The next best action is to change my direction. I can either turn left or right. 

If I turn left, I will be facing north, and if I turn right, I will be facing south. Both directions may provide a path forward. However, since I don't have information about what lies in those directions, I will choose to turn left to face north.

There is a wall directly ahead.
=====================

Reasoning: Since I am facing east and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. The next best action is to change my orientation. I can either turn left to face north or turn right to face south. 

Turning left (to face north) would allow me to explore a new direction without hitting a wall, while turning right (to face south) might also provide a clear path. However, since I have no information about what lies to the north or south, I will choose to turn left to face north, as it is a common strategy to explore new areas.

There is a wall directly ahead.
=====================

Reasoning: Since I am currently facing north and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. The next logical action is to change my direction. I can either turn left or right. 

If I turn left, I will be facing west, and if I turn right, I will be facing east. Since I have already faced east and encountered walls, turning left to face west seems like a better option, as it may provide a new path to explore.

Therefore, I will take the action:

Reasoning: Since I am currently facing south and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I need to change my direction. The most efficient way to do this is to turn either left or right. 

If I turn left, I will be facing east, and if I turn right, I will be facing west. Both directions should allow me to move forward afterward, assuming there are no walls in those directions. 

To maximize my options, I will turn left first, as it may provide a clearer path toward the goal.
