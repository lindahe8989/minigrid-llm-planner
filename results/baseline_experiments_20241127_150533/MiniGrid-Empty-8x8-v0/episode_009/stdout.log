There is a wall directly ahead.
=====================

Reasoning: Since I am currently facing east and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I can either turn left or right. 

If I turn left, I will be facing north, and I can then check if the path is clear in that direction. If I turn right, I will be facing south, and I can also check if the path is clear in that direction. 

To proceed efficiently, I will choose to turn left, as it may provide a clearer path towards the goal without backtracking.

=====================

Reasoning: Since I am facing north and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. The next logical step is to change my direction. I can either turn left or right. 

If I turn left, I will be facing west, and if I turn right, I will be facing east. Since I have already faced east and encountered a wall, turning left to face west seems like a better option to explore new directions.

Therefore, I will take the action:

Reasoning: Since I am facing west and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I can either turn left or right. 

Turning left will have me face south, and turning right will have me face north. I need to determine which direction will allow me to continue moving toward the goal (G). 

If I turn left (to face south), I can then move forward if the path is clear. If I turn right (to face north), I will also need to check if the path is clear in that direction. 

Since I have no information about the surrounding environment beyond the wall, I will choose to turn left, as it is often a good strategy to explore new directions when blocked.

If I turn left, I will be facing south, and I can then check if the path is clear in that direction. If I turn right, I will be facing north, and I can also check if the path is clear in that direction. 

To explore the environment and find a way to the goal, I will choose to turn left first.

=====================

Reasoning: Since I am facing west and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I can either turn left or right. 

Turning left will face me south, and turning right will face me north. I need to consider the potential paths available after the turn. 

If I turn left (to face south), I can then check if there is a clear path in that direction. If I turn right (to face north), I will also need to check for any obstacles. 

Given that I have no information about the surrounding area beyond the immediate wall, I will choose to turn left to explore the south direction first.

Reasoning: Since I am facing west and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I can either turn left or right. 

Turning left will make me face south, and turning right will make me face north. I need to determine which direction might lead me closer to the goal (G). 

Given that I cannot see the entire environment and only have a limited field of vision, I will choose to turn right to face north. This may allow me to explore further without being blocked by the wall.

=== Current State ===
You are facing east.

There is a wall directly ahead.
=====================

Reasoning: Since I am facing east and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. The next best action is to change my direction. I can either turn left to face north or right to face south. 

Turning left (to face north) might provide a clearer path since I can then explore the area to my left. Therefore, I will choose to turn left.

=====================

Reasoning: Since I am facing east and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I can either turn left or right. 

If I turn left, I will be facing north, and I can then assess if there is a clear path in that direction. If I turn right, I will be facing south, and I can also check for a clear path. 

To explore my options, I will turn left first.

Reasoning: Since I am facing east and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I can either turn left or right. 

If I turn left, I will be facing north, and if I turn right, I will be facing south. I need to choose one of these options to find a path towards the goal (G). 

Turning left (to face north) might provide more options to explore, as I can then check if there are any openings or paths in that direction. 

Therefore, I will take the action:

You are facing north.

There is a wall directly ahead.
=====================

Reasoning: Since I am currently facing north and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. The next logical step is to change my direction. I can either turn left or right. 

If I turn left, I will be facing west, and if I turn right, I will be facing east. However, I know that I have already encountered walls when facing east, so turning left to face west may provide a better opportunity to navigate around the wall.

Therefore, I will take the action to turn left.
