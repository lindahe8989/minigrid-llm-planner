=====================

Reasoning: Since I am currently facing east and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I can either turn left or right. 

If I turn left, I will be facing north, and I can then check if there is a clear path in that direction. If I turn right, I will be facing south, and I can also check for a clear path in that direction. 

To explore the options, I will choose to turn left first, as it may provide a clearer route towards the goal.

There is a wall directly ahead.
=====================

Reasoning: Since I am currently facing west and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I can either turn left or right. 

Turning left will make me face south, and turning right will make me face north. I need to choose one of these directions to continue moving towards the goal (G). 

Turning left (south) seems like a good option, as it may provide a clearer path to move forward. 

Therefore, I will take the action:
