=== Current State ===
You are facing east.

There is a wall directly ahead.
=====================

Reasoning: Since I am currently facing east and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I can either turn left or right. 

If I turn left, I will be facing north, and if I turn right, I will be facing south. I need to choose a direction that allows me to continue making progress toward the goal (G). 

Turning left (to face north) may provide a clearer path, as I can then move forward if there are no obstacles in that direction. 

Therefore, I will take the action to turn left.

=====================

Reasoning: Since I am facing east and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I can either turn left or right. 

Turning left will face me north, and turning right will face me south. I need to choose a direction that allows me to continue making progress toward the goal (G). 

If I turn left (north), I can then check if there is a clear path to move forward. If I turn right (south), I can also check for a clear path. However, since I have not encountered any walls to the left or right in the previous steps, I will choose to turn left first.

There is a wall directly ahead.
=====================

Reasoning: Since I am facing east and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I should turn either left or right. 

If I turn left, I will be facing north, and if I turn right, I will be facing south. I need to choose one of these directions to find a path towards the goal (G). 

Turning left (to face north) might give me more options to explore, as I can then check if there are any openings or paths in that direction. 

Therefore, I will take the action:

There is a wall directly ahead.
=====================

Reasoning: Since I am currently facing north and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. The next logical step is to change my direction. I can either turn left or right. 

If I turn left, I will be facing west, and if I turn right, I will be facing east. Since I have already faced east and encountered walls, turning left to face west seems like a better option, as it may provide a new path to explore.

Therefore, I will take the action: 

Generated action: left

Reasoning: Since I am currently facing north and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. The next best option is to change my direction. I can either turn left or right. 

If I turn left, I will be facing west, and I may have a clear path to move forward. If I turn right, I will be facing east, which might also provide a clear path. However, since I have already been moving west and there is a wall in front of me, it is more logical to turn right and explore the eastern direction.

There is a wall directly ahead.
=====================

Reasoning: Since I am facing north and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. The next step is to change my direction. I can either turn left or right. 

If I turn left, I will be facing west, and I can then move forward since the path was clear in previous steps. If I turn right, I will be facing east, which may also allow me to move forward if the path is clear in that direction.

To maximize my chances of moving towards the goal efficiently, I will turn right to face east.

There is a wall directly ahead.
=====================

Reasoning: Since I am facing north and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. The next logical step is to change my orientation to find a clear path. I can either turn left or right. 

Turning left will make me face west, and turning right will make me face east. Since I have previously moved west and encountered walls, it might be more beneficial to turn right and face east, as it may provide a clearer path forward.

Therefore, I will take the action:

Action taken: forward

Step 38:
State: You are facing west.

There is a wall directly ahead.
Action taken: forward


=== Current State ===
You are facing west.

There is a wall directly ahead.
=====================

Reasoning: Since I am currently facing west and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I need to change my direction. The most efficient way to do this would be to turn right, which will allow me to face north and potentially find a clear path towards the goal.

Therefore, the action I will take is:

Generated action: right

Executing action: right (value: 1)
Step result: reward=0, terminated=False, truncated=False

=== Current State ===
You are facing north.

There is a wall directly ahead.
=====================

Reasoning: Since I am currently facing north and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. The next best option is to change my direction. I can either turn left to face west or right to face east. 

Turning left would have me face west, where I have just come from, and I know there is a wall directly ahead in that direction as well. Therefore, the more efficient action is to turn right, which will allow me to face east. This direction may provide a clearer path towards the goal.

Thus, the action I will take is:

Generated action: right

Executing action: right (value: 1)
Step result: reward=0, terminated=False, truncated=False
