There is a wall directly ahead.
=====================

Reasoning: Since I am currently facing east and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I can either turn left or right. 

If I turn left, I will be facing north, and I can then check if the path is clear in that direction. If I turn right, I will be facing south, and I can also check if the path is clear there. 

To explore the options, I will choose to turn left first, as it may provide a clearer path towards the goal.

=====================

Reasoning: Since I am facing east and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I can either turn left or right. 

If I turn left, I will be facing north, and if I turn right, I will be facing south. I need to choose one of these directions to find a clear path toward the goal (G). 

Turning left (to face north) may provide a better chance of finding an open path, as it allows me to explore a new direction. 

Therefore, I will take the action:

You are facing north.

There is a wall directly ahead.
=====================

Reasoning: Since I am currently facing north and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. The next logical step is to turn either left or right to find a clear path. 

If I turn left, I will be facing west, and if I turn right, I will be facing east. Since I have previously moved east and encountered a wall, turning right would not be beneficial. Therefore, I will turn left to face west, which may provide a clearer path.

=== Current State ===
You are facing west.

There is a wall directly ahead.
=====================

Reasoning: Since I am facing west and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I can either turn left or right. 

If I turn left, I will be facing south, and I can then check if there is a clear path to move forward. If I turn right, I will be facing north, and I can also check for a clear path. 

To explore the environment and find a way to the goal, I will choose to turn left first.

=====================

Reasoning: Since I am facing west and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I need to change my direction. The most efficient way to do this is to turn right, which will allow me to face north and potentially find a clear path towards the goal.

=====================

Reasoning: Since I am facing west and there is a wall directly ahead, I cannot move forward. To navigate around the wall, I can either turn left or right. 

If I turn left, I will be facing south, and if I turn right, I will be facing north. I need to choose a direction that will allow me to continue moving towards the goal (G). 

Turning left (to face south) may provide more options for movement, as I can then move forward if there are no obstacles in that direction. 

Therefore, I will turn left.

If I turn left, I will be facing south, and if I turn right, I will be facing north. I need to choose one of these directions to find a path towards the goal (G).
